# Find_The_Fake
 Simple spot the imposter demo game

 Plan is for a simple FPS controller, the player can move around a small room/scene.
 Utilizing Godot's VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D to determine when an 'imposter' entity is visible within the player's camera.

 The idea being, the player will walk around and observe a bunch of identitcal entities, that may move or fidget around, and based on a button press,
 and using obstacles like walls and level geometry, the game will tell you if an imposter entity is visble on screen.

 The goal being to find and label all the imposter entities within a limited time-frame.

 No idea if I'll be able to make this fun or interesting in anyway, but I suppose that's what prototyping is for, gotta start somewhere.
